Hereâ€™s a description for the repository on sensitivity analysis in the Minimal Ventricular Model:

Sensitivity Analysis in Minimal Ventricular Model
This repository contains the code and resources for performing sensitivity analysis on the Minimal Ventricular Model (MVM) by Bueno-Orovio, a mathematical model used to simulate the electrical activity of the heart. The goal of this analysis is to identify and quantify the influence of various model parameters on key outputs such as action potential duration (APD), maximum upstroke velocity, and ionic current dynamics.

Key features include:

- Global and Local Sensitivity Analysis: Methods like Sobol indices and partial derivative analysis to assess parameter sensitivity.
- Parameter Impact on Electrophysiological Behavior: Study the effect of variations in parameters like conductance, time constants, and ion channel dynamics.
- Automated Simulations: Python-based scripts to automatically run simulations with varying parameter sets and collect data.
- Optimized for Cardiac Models: Tailored specifically for cardiac electrophysiology, with built-in support for the Bueno-Orovio MVM.

This project helps in understanding the robustness and behavior of the MVM, guiding model refinement and experimental design by highlighting the most critical parameters affecting model outcomes.
